### Fractals: Natures building blocks
Implementing a software that would plot two of the most popular fractals: "Mandelbrot set" and "Julia set". Fractals are infinity precise, self-similar shapes formed
by some simple mathematical computations. The computation varies from fractal set to set but are
generally based on complex numbers.
